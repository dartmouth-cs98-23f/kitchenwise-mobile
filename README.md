# kitchenwise-mobile

Command your kitchen.
Have you ever gone to the grocery store, seen something that piqued your interest, and thought "do I already have this?"
Have you ever forgotten to add a critical item to your shopping list and, one day later, opened the fridge disappointed?

## Architecture
